# Lending Club Predictive Modelling

Lending Club is an American peer to peer lending company. The dataset was obtained from [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/jakubwarmuz/lending-club-dataset?select=loan.csv)

It includes 2M+ entries with 145 features, such as client's demographics and loan details. A more thorough description of the features can be found in the LCDataDictionary.xlsx file.

The aim of this project was to conduct a basic exploratory data analysis and create a model that predicts which clients will default on their loans. Such a model could be used by the lending company to prevent from issuing loans to people with a high risk of becoming insolvent. The results were satisfactory judging by multiple metrics, e.g. the F1 Score, which equaled to 0.85
